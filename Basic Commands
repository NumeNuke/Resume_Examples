Your team is investigating failed login attempts that were made after business hours. You want to retrieve this information from the login activity. Youâ€™ll identify all unsuccessful attempts after 18:00.

The login_time column in the log_in_attempts table contains information on when login attempts were made. Office hours end at '18:00'.

The success column in the log_in_attempts table contains values of TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether the login was successful. MySQL stores Boolean values as 1 for TRUE, and 0 for FALSE. This means that TRUE is represented as 1, and FALSE represented as 0 in the success column.

SELECT*
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_attempts > '18:00' AND success = FALSE ;
